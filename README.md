# My Ubuntu minimal i3wm Install

![pic1](pic1.png)

## Setup.sh
Once Ubuntu minimal finishes installing, wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TeenCorn/UbuntMini_i3wm/master/setup.sh, chmod 777 setup.sh, and let it do its magic!

## Programs Installed

+ i3wm (The latest stable build. NOT the one from the Ubuntu repository)
+ termite (I don't like urxvt configuration)
+ vim
+ ranger
+ mpv
+ Thunar (So phones and usb can be mounted automatically)
