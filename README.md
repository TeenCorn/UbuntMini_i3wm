## Setup.sh
Once Ubuntu minimal finishes installing, wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TeenCorn/UbuntMini_i3wm/master/setup.sh, chmod +x setup.sh, and let it do its magic!

## Options
The setup.sh script ask you whether or not you would like to uninstall Flash from your computer since it's automatically installed with ubuntu-restricted-extras. REGARDLESS of what choice you make, y/n, the script will install gstreamer1.0-plugins-{bad,good,ugly,base}. I do this because I will eventually get rid of it later and so I won't have to install gstreamer manually later on. I only have flash because I need it for a website for my class.
